  Susa is a mathematics and signal processing C++ framework based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>
  principle. It is stand-alone with a modern architecture. It is designed not to have any dependencies to none standard third
  party libraries. Indeed, a C++11 compiler along with STL is necessary and sufficient in order to compile it. Therefore,
  portability is the key feature of Susa. For example it can be used in mobile platforms such as Android 
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/">NDK</a> (Native Development Toolkit) without any restriction.
  This brings the power and speed of the C++ native code to the user friendly Java based mobile applications.
  
  Susa is also a simulation framework for the researchers and engineers who design
  computational systems. It has linear algebra, signal processing and common communications blocks.
  A matrix and array template class are at the heart of Susa with a constellation of classes and functions.

  <p> The highlights of this framework other than providing basic mathematical tools are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Matrix and multi-dimensional array types (template classes),</li>
    <li>Linear algebraic operations and analysis (e.g. Determinant and SVD),</li>
    <li>Signal processing operations (e.g. FFT, Filter (FIR/IIR), Convolution and Random Number Generators),</li>
    <li>Convolutional Forward Error Correction (FEC) blocks: encoder, MLSE (Viterbi) and MAP (BCJR) decoders,</li>
    <li>Channel equalizers: MLSE (Viterbi) and MAP (BCJR).</li>
  </ul>

  Unearthed tablets from Susa (2000 BC) revealed a rather precise calculation of Pi = 3.125 with the fractional part whereas
  the other earlier efforts calculated the integer part. Since the very first line of code was simply the definition of constant Pi,
  it has been named Susa.
