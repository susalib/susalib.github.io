  Susa is a mathematics and signal processing C++ framework based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> principle.
  The mobility is the key feature of Susa. It is a stand-alone and modern signal processing framework that can easily be ported
  to mobile platforms. It is designed not to have any dependencies to any none standard third party library. A C++11
  compiler is neccessary and sufficient in order to compile it. Therefore, Susa can be exploited in mobile platforms such as
  Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/">NDK</a> (Native Development Toolkit) without restriction.
  This brings the power and speed of the C++ native code to the user friendly Java based mobile applications.

  Susa is also a simulation framework for the researchers and engineers who design computational systems. It has linear algebra,
  signal processing and communications common methods.

  <p>Highlights of this framework other than providing basic mathematical tools are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Convolutional Forward Error Correction (FEC) computational blocks (Encoder, Viterbi and BCJR decoders),</li>
    <li>Channel equalizer (Viterbi and BCJR decoders),</li>
    <li>Linear algebraic operations and analysis (e.g. Determinant and SVD),</li>
    <li>Signal processing operations (e.g. FFT, Filter, Convolution and Random Number Generators).</li>
  </ul>
