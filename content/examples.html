    These examples helps the developers understand how the famework functions.
    They also show the capabilities and potentials that can be exploited in the signal processing and simulation projects.
    Moreover, the code is aimed to demonstrate and guide. Therefore, advanced simulation methods (e.g. Monte Carlo) are avoided in the examples.
    The source codes are found under the <a href="https://github.com/behrooza/susa/tree/master/examples">examples</a> folder.
