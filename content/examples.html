    These examples help the developers understand how to use the framework.
    They also show the capabilities and potentials that can be employed in your projects.
    Moreover, the code is aimed to demonstrate and guide. Therefore, advanced simulation methods (e.g. Monte Carlo) are avoided in the examples.
    The source codes are found under the <a href="https://github.com/libsusa/susa/tree/master/examples">examples</a> folder.

The <a href="https://github.com/libsusa/susa/tree/master/test">test cases</a> are also a learning material specially for those parts of Susa
that have not been used in the examples.
